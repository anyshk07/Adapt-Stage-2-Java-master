1.    Create an interface AdminService. Add CRUD methods such as addToy(Toy toy) , updateToy(Toy toy), deleteToy(int toyId) and getToys() (will return array of toys) . These methods will be for adding new toys, modifying existing toys, deleting toys, retrieving the details of all the toys (you should use the same Toy class with all the attributes as mentioned in the given structure)



2.      AdminsServiceImpl class with the static array named toyArray and provide implementation AdminService interfaces (override all the methods listed in interface).



3,Override toString method which will return the concatenated String (toyname,type,price and rentalAmount)



4.user must be asked to give their choice to perform different operations as below

1. Add Toys
2. UpdateToys
3 Delete Toys
4 Display Toys
