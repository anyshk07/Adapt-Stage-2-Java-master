In the class named Source create the following public static method:

checkRegistrationNumber(String):int	 
The input parameter is a vehicle registration number and the output is -1, 0 or 1 based on below given rules.
If the Vehicle registration number is valid as per the below format the method should return 0, else -1
PPXXQQYYYY
PP - Should be either KA or DL
XX - Number from 01 to 10
QQ - 1 or 2 alphabets from A-Z(uppercase)
YYYY - Number from 1000 to 9999 
Ex: KA01MG2323, DL10G5454
Method should return 1, if the registration number is valid, and last 4 digits add up to a lucky number. When last 4 digits are repeatedly added(see below) and the sum is 6, it is a lucky number
