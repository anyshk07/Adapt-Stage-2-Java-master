Main class Source should have the functionality to validate the input hexadecimal and decimal colour codes.

Create two static methods in class ColourCodeValidator as per the below signature



validateHexCode(String):int

Both the methods return 1 for valid codes and -1 for invalid codes. Rules for valid codes are given below
Hexadecimal code rules



Format: #A1BC23

x,y and z are values from 0 to 255 inclusive
In the main method , do the following



Accept the inputs using Console as shown in the Example section
First input is choice based on which one of the static methods should be invoked
choice 1 is for validating the input hexadecimal colour code
choice 2 is for validating the input decimal colour code
