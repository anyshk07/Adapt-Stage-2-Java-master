Complete the application as per the below design to search for doctors based on speciality/years of experience.

The application consists of 3 classes : Doctor, DoctorService and SearchDoctorApp. Complete the given classes as below.

class Doctor This pre-written class contains the instance variables: name, speciality and experience, Getters/Setters, Constructors and overridden toString method. This class may need some changes based on the requirement.

class DoctorService - Contains an instance variable doctorsRepository of type List<Doctor>, which can be initialized using the constructor provided. Create the below methods in this class, for searching doctors from the doctorsRepository List



getExperiencedDoctors(int):List<Doctor>

- This method takes years of experience as input parameter and returns a List of Doctors, who have experience equal to or more than the input parameter
- The returned List should be sorted in ascending order of speciality and descending order of experience for a speciality. (This should be natural sorting order of Doctor class) 

getSpecialityDoctor(String):Set<Doctor>
- This method takes speciality(case insensitive) as input parameter and returns a Set of Doctors who have this speciality
- The returned Set should be sorted in ascending order of name of Doctor
class SearchDoctorApp This class contains a static variable doctorsData which is initialized with details of 9 doctors in the below format.



name-speciality-experience;name-speciality-experience;...
Note: Do not change the data provided in static block

Do the following in the main method



Create Doctor objects using the data present in doctorsData variable and add these objects to a ArrayList of Doctors
Initialize the doctorsRepository variable of DoctorService with the above ArrayList
Accept 1 or 2 as choice from the user through Console.
If choice is 1, accept years of experience as second input. Invoke appropriate method of DoctorService and display the doctors as per the below format
If choice is 2, accept speciality as second input. Invoke appropriate method of DoctorService and display the doctors as per the below format
Display "No Doctors Found", if there are no doctors matching the search criteria
Display "Invalid Choice", if the first input is not 1 or 2
